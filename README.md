### Description

An intro assignment for our section on Backbone.js. We'll handle just Backbone.Model and Backbone.Events for starters. This should be a gentle introduction into these foundational Backbone concepts.

Read through the following sections in the Backbone documentation:

* [Introduction](http://backbonejs.org/#introduction)
* [Events](http://backbonejs.org/#Events)
* [Model](http://backbonejs.org/#Model)

### Normal Mode - Step 2

Standard TDD assignment -- just make the tests pass.
